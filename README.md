# Synopsis

This project was bootstrapped with React. The primary goal of this project was to learn different React-elements while using common React components and functions which a normal project would use. The project itself was an attempt at making a website builder with React. 

# Transpiry

Due to a lack of knowledge, I was unable to get over a certain hurdle. Although this hasn't stopped me in the past, I have decided that I have gotten what I need out of this project. The project is in a close-to-working state and it's possible to make a very basic website.

# Future
I am hoping to return to this project once I am better equiped and potentially complete the project.
For now however, this project will sit as a reminder as to what my first project of interest was like.
This project may see a revival with a full conversion to dnd-kit based components and a better approach to storing and converting the stored components.

# Running
Make sure you install all dependecies using `npm install`, then use `npm run` to start the project. Feel free to take a look at the code and see if you can tackle it for yourself.
